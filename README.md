# WPI RBE 3001 - Turtlebot 3 Slam

SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) is a method used for autonomous vehicles that lets you build a map and localize your vehicle in that map at the same time. SLAM algorithms allow the vehicle to map out unknown environments. Engineers use the map information  to carry out tasks such as path planning and obstacle avoidance.
